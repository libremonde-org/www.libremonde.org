We empower individuals in regard to information technologies, software and their privacy in a hyper-connected world.

Our goals are to:

- Ensure individuals have access to knowledge and guides
- Allow individuals to educate themselves to new technologies and their impact on privacy.
- Empower individuals by giving them the means and tools to understand how technologies, software and products work.
- Protect individuals' privacy by researching practices of various organisations.
- Make sure individuals are not controlled by their software, tools and devices.

We are given an unlimited and worldwide mandate to do so, including collaboration with other organisations that share our goals.
